# Coworking Space Service Extension
The Coworking Space Service is a set of APIs that enables users to request one-time tokens and administrators to authorize access to a coworking space. This service follows a microservice pattern and the APIs are split into distinct services that can be deployed and managed independently of one another.

For this project, you are a DevOps engineer who will be collaborating with a team that is building an API for business analysts. The API provides business analysts basic analytics data on user activity in the service. The application they provide you functions as expected locally and you are expected to help build a pipeline to deploy it in Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
#### Local Environment
1. Python Environment - run Python 3.6+ applications and install Python dependencies via `pip`
2. Docker CLI - build and run Docker images locally
3. `kubectl` - run commands against a Kubernetes cluster
4. `helm` - apply Helm Charts to a Kubernetes cluster

#### Remote Resources
1. AWS CodeBuild - build Docker images remotely
2. AWS ECR - host Docker images
3. Kubernetes Environment with AWS EKS - run applications in k8s
4. AWS CloudWatch - monitor activity and logs in EKS
5. GitHub - pull and clone code

### Setup
#### 1. Configure a Database
Set up a Postgres database using a Helm Chart.

1. Set up Bitnami Repo
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

2. Install PostgreSQL Helm Chart
```
helm install my-postgres bitnami/postgresql

```
Replace my-postgres with your desired release name.

3. Verify Deployment

Ensure that the PostgreSQL deployment is successful by checking the status of the deployed resources
```
kubectl get svc

```

5. Connect to PostgreSQL Database

You can connect to the PostgreSQL database either via port forwarding or by accessing a pod within the cluster.

Port Forwarding Method:
```
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/my-postgres-postgresql 5432:5432 &
PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" psql --host 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432
```

Accessing via Pod:

```
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> -- bash
PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" psql --host <POSTGRES_HOST> -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432
```

Replace <POD_NAME> with the name of the PostgreSQL pod and <POSTGRES_HOST> with the hostname of the PostgreSQL service.

6. Run Seed Files (Optional)

   If you have seed files to initialize your database schema and populate it with data, you can run them using the psql command:

```
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/my-postgres-postgresql 5432:5432 &
PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" psql --host 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432 < <FILE_NAME.sql>
```
Replace <FILE_NAME.sql> with the name of your SQL seed file.

### 2. Running the Analytics Application Locally
In the `analytics/` directory:

1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the application (see below regarding environment variables)
```bash
<ENV_VARS> python app.py
```

There are multiple ways to set environment variables in a command. They can be set per session by running `export KEY=VAL` in the command line or they can be prepended into your command.

* `DB_USERNAME`
* `DB_PASSWORD`
* `DB_HOST` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
* `DB_PORT` (defaults to `5432`)
* `DB_NAME` (defaults to `postgres`)

If we set the environment variables by prepending them, it would look like the following:
```bash
DB_USERNAME=username_here DB_PASSWORD=password_here python app.py
```
The benefit here is that it's explicitly set. However, note that the `DB_PASSWORD` value is now recorded in the session's history in plaintext. There are several ways to work around this including setting environment variables in a file and sourcing them in a terminal session.

3. Verifying The Application
* Generate report for check-ins grouped by dates
`curl <BASE_URL>/api/reports/daily_usage`

* Generate report for check-ins grouped by users
`curl <BASE_URL>/api/reports/user_visits`

## Project Instructions
1. Set up a Postgres database with a Helm Chart
2. Create a `Dockerfile` for the Python application. Use a base image that is Python-based.
3. Write a simple build pipeline with AWS CodeBuild to build and push a Docker image into AWS ECR
4. Create a service and deployment using Kubernetes configuration files to deploy the application
5. Check AWS CloudWatch for application logs

### Deliverables
1. [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
2. Screenshot of AWS CodeBuild pipeline
3. Screenshot of AWS ECR repository for the application's repository
4. Screenshot of `kubectl get svc`
5. Screenshot of `kubectl get pods`
6. Screenshot of `kubectl describe svc <DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME>`
7. Screenshot of `kubectl describe deployment <SERVICE_NAME>`
8. All Kubernetes config files used for deployment (ie [configmap](./deployment/configmap.yaml))
9. Screenshot of AWS CloudWatch logs for the application
10. `README.md` file in your solution that serves as documentation for your user to detail how your deployment process works and how the user can deploy changes. The details should not simply rehash what you have done on a step by step basis. Instead, it should help an experienced software developer understand the technologies and tools in the build and deploy process as well as provide them insight into how they would release new builds.


### Stand Out Suggestions
Please provide up to 3 sentences for each suggestion. Additional content in your submission from the standout suggestions do _not_ impact the length of your total submission.
1. Specify reasonable Memory and CPU allocation in the Kubernetes deployment configuration
2. In your README, specify what AWS instance type would be best used for the application? Why?
3. In your README, provide your thoughts on how we can save on costs?

### Best Practices
* Dockerfile uses an appropriate base image for the application being deployed. Complex commands in the Dockerfile include a comment describing what it is doing.
* The Docker images use semantic versioning with three numbers separated by dots, e.g. `1.2.1` and  versioning is visible in the  screenshot. See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for more details.emantic versioning with three numbers separated by dots, e.g. `1.2.1` and  versioning is visible in the  screenshot.
